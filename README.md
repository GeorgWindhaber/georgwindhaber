### Hi!

I am Georg Windhaber, a mostly frontend dev living the full ~~javascript~~ typescript life!

I mostly use Vue/Nuxt and React/Next to create frontends but am also dipping more and into the full-stack with Next.js. Anything that is state of the art and has cool flexible features with a clean look excites me.

I also do UI/UX designing but not here on github.
